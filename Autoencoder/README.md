# Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection
Business problem :- To Rank order the transactions in their likelihood of being Fraud  (Anomaly Detection)

Possible ways :
1. Supervised :- Using Non_linear Algorithms like Bagging(Random Forest),Boosting(Ada,GBM,XGBoost etc.)
2. Supervised :- Using Deep Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks
3. UnSupervised :- Using K-Means Clustering
4. Self-Supervised :- Auroencoders

Method Selected - Autoencoder
