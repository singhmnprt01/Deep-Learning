# Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection
Business problem :- To Rank order the transactions in their likelihood of being Fraud  (Anomaly Detection)

Possible ways :
1. Supervised ML :- Using Advance Non_linear Algorithms like Bagging(Random Forest),Boosting(Ada,GBM,XGBoost etc.)
2. Supervised DL :- Using Deep Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks
3. UnSupervised DL :- Using K-Means Clustering
4. Self-Supervised DL :- Auroencoders

Method Selected - Autoencoder
