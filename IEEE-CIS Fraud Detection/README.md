# ML for Fraudulent Transactions
### Business problem :- Predict the probability that an online transaction is fraudulent 

#### Defined a new KPI for fraud as harmonic_fraud_rate between fraud_percent and relative_fraud_percent to balance the effect. An alternative to PCA and feature reduction, this method can be used to reduce categories of any categorical variable. 
Note: harmonic_fraud_rate can be tuned as per various different datasets based on region, class, business, etc. as a hyperparameter to tune the feature set count
